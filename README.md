## Steps to Install and Configure Software 

### Frontend

```bash

cd library-frontend

npm install

npm run dev

```

### Backend
  
```python
 
cd library-backend
 
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
flask run
 
```

## Environment Configuration (library-backend/.env)

The `library-backend` folder includes a `.env` file required to configure sensitive settings like email functionality. For security reasons, email credentials are left blank and must be filled in manually.

### How to Edit `.env`:
1. Open the `.env` file located in `library-backend`.

2. Add your email credentials:

```bash
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
```

**Important Notes:**

- Do not use your personal email password.

- If you're using Gmail:

  - Enable 2-Step Verification: https://myaccount.google.com/security

  - Generate an App Password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

3. Save the file and restart the backend (`flask run`).

### Example `.env` File After Configuration

```bash
MAIL_USERNAME=libraryadmin@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefg12345678
```
